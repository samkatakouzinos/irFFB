# irFFB

irFFB can feed the 360 Hz steering column torque data recently made available in iRacing telemetry to your wheel, upsample and apply low-latency digital filters to the standard (60 Hz) iRacing FFB output and modify the feedback via a number of effects based on live telemetry.

It can also drive a 'Jetseat' and fans if you have them.

There's more detail in the wiki..
